This repository contains the code and graphics used in my master's thesis: “A Synergistic Use of Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Data for the Long-term Evolution of Biocrusts and their Activity Across Diverse Dryland Ecosystems”.

This includes Google Earth Engine codes to generate data, Python scripts to download Sentinel 1 data and R Scripts to postprocess, analyze and visualize the data.
